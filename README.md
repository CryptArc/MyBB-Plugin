MyBB-Plugin
===========

A plugin to integrate Omnicoin into MyBB forums.

The [Omnicoin team](https://github.com/Omnicoin-Project/Omnicoin/wiki/Omnicoin-Team) are developing this plugin.

This plugin uses the Omnicha.in API to verify addresses and add them to a database. Addresses and history are displayed on each profile. Balances of the current address are displayed on posts by that user and on their profile. Addresses are added via User CP "Edit Profile" page.

Our next goal is to create a "Search by address" page, which would also help fight scammers.

We hope to eventually complete full integration into the forum, including tipping systems, automated upgrade and sticky purchases, etc. But these developments are fully under the disgression of [Omniscient](http://www.hackforums.net/member.php?action=profile&uid=1), and potential security risks related to stored balances/private keys must be considered and solved before these further developments can take place.
